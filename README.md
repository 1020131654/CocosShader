[A live demo is here.](http://supersuraccoon.github.io/CocosShader)

A `Cocos2d-JS v3.9` based demo with following features:

- Blending Mode Effect Collection
- Shader Effect Collection
- Shader Object
- Grid Effect
    - Grid3D
    - TiledGrid3D
- JSBinding Support

Note:

Need to add some missing `Glue` functions to the `JSBinding` source code. Refer to the files in `framework/cocos2d-x/...` and search for `supersuraccoon`.
